# OrderCloud.io SDK for .NET

[![OrderCloud.SDK](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/OrderCloud.SDK.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OrderCloud.SDK/)

The OrderCloud.io SDK for .NET is a client library for building solutions targeting the [OrderCloud.io](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation/) eCommerce platform using C# or other .NET language. Compared to accessing OrderCloud.io's REST API via direct HTTP calls, the SDK aims to greatly improve developer productivity and reduce errors by providing discoverable, strongly typed wrappers for all public endpoints and request/response models.

## Example
```c#
using OrderCloud.SDK;

var client = new OrderCloudClient(new OrderCloudClientConfig {
    ClientId = "my-client-id",
    
    // client credentials grant flow:
    ClientSecret = "my-client-secret"
    
    // OR password grant flow:
    Username = u,
    Password = p,
    
    Roles = new[] { ApiRole.OrderAdmin }
});

var orders = await client.Orders.ListAsync(OrderDirection.Incoming, filters: new { Status = OrderStatus.Open });

Console.WriteLine($"{orders.Meta.TotalCount} open orders found.");
Console.WriteLine($"Fetched page {orders.Meta.Page} of {orders.Meta.TotalPages}.");
foreach (var order in orders.Items) {
    Console.WriteLine($"ID: {order.ID}, Total: {order.Total:C}");
}

```

## Authenticating

OrderCloud.io uses OAuth2 for authentication and authorization. In a nutshell, you provide a set of credentials, acquire a temporary access token, and provide that token in the HTTP headers on subsequent API calls. Using the SDK, you have a few options to simplify this process, depending on the scenario:

1. Configure `OrderCloudClient` with a set of credentials, as in the [example](#example) above. This is ideal for scheduled batch jobs, and you should prefer the client credentials grant (shared secret) flow since this processing isn't usually triggered by or on behalf of a particular user. With this method, you don't need to explicitly authenticate or keep track of access tokens - the SDK will acquire, cache, and refresh tokens implicitly as needed. Just configure the client and start making calls. (And please, please, _PLEASE_ keep shared secrets and user credentials securly locked down, such as with [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/).)

2. Use an existing access token. A typical use case is when a user has already authenticated with OrderCloud in a front-end app and you want some custom endpoint to perform actions on behalf of that user. _Do not pass the user's credentials to your custom endpoint_. Instead, pass their token (always over SSL). Every method in the SDK that calls an OrderCloud endpoint takes an optional `accessToken` argument, allowing you to ignore any configured credentials and use the ad-hoc token:

    ```c#
    await client.Products.GetAsync(id, theUserToken);
    ```
 
    _Note: If you're using ASP.NET Core to build endpoints that are passed user tokens, have a look at the OrderCloud user authentication extensions provided by [OrderCloud.AzureApp](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/ordercloud-dotnet-sdk-extensions)._

3. Acquire tokens manually. There should be very few use cases where this is necessary, but authenticating manually is possible. (Please, please, _PLEASE_ keep shared secrets and user credentials securly locked down, such as with [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/).)

    ```c#
    var response = await AuthenticateAsync(clientID, username, password, ApiRole.ProductReader);
    // or
    var response = await AuthenticateAsync(clientID, secret, ApiRole.ProductReader);

    var token = response.AccessToken; // repsonse also includes ExpiresUtc and RefreshToken.
    client.Products.GetAsync(id, token);
    ```

## Notable Features
Here are a few niceties that the SDK provides. Features of the OrderCloud.io _platform_ are documented [here](https://developer.ordercloud.io/documentation).

### Strongly Typed xp
Extended Properties, or `xp`, is a platform feature that allows you to extend the OrderCloud.io data model. This is modeled in the SDK using (by default) a C# [dynamic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/dynamic).

Even though `Gender` does not exist the native model, the code below will compile and work just fine with the API. But with dynamics you don't get compile-time type checking. Alternatively, the SDK provides generic versions of all models that allow you to provide a custom `xp` type:

```c#
public class MyUserXp
{
    public string Gender { get; set; }
}

var user = new User<MyUserXp>();
user.xp = new MyUserXp() {
    Gender = "male"
}; // strongly typed!
```

This time `Gender` is strongly typed, so you'll get the compile-time checking, Intellisense, autocomplete, etc. that you get with first-class properties. This is also available on calls that GET an object (or list):

```c#
var user = await client.Users.GetAsync<User<MyUserXp>>(buyerId, userId);
Console.WriteLine(user.xp.Gender); // strongly typed!
```

A common alternative to the above example is to first define a custom class that _inherits_ from `User<MyUserXp>`:

```c#
public class MyUser : User<MyUserXp> { }
```

Now calls to `GetAsync<User<MyUserXp>>(...)` can be simplified to `GetAsync<MyUser>(...)`. This is especially preferable when working with models that have nested models, each with their own custom xp type, which must all be declared on the top-level model. For example: `Order<Txp, TFromUserXP, TBillingAddressXP>`. Declaring those 3 xp types once on a custom `MyOrder` class is far cleaner than declaring them on every call to `GetAsync` or `ListAsync`.

### Strongly Typed Partials

OrderCloud.io supports PATCH endpoints for partially updating a resource. The idea is that if you only send the fields you want to change, you not only reduce the payload, you might also avoid excessive GETs that could be needed if the entire model was required for an update. For example, here's how you might activate an inactive user:

```c#
await client.Users.PatchAsync(buyerId, userId, new PartialUser { Active = true });
```

`PartialUser` is a type provided out of the box by the SDK (and similarly for all models with a corresponding PATCH endpoint). A couple things to note about `PartialUser`:

1. It has all the same strongly-typed properties as `User`; in fact, it inherits from `User`.

2. What makes it different from `User` is how it gets serialized to JSON when the the API call is made. Instead of serializing _all_ properties, it only serializes those that are _explicitly set_. (In this example, `{"Active":true}` is all that's sent in the request body.) This behavior is important to understand - once you set a property, you cannot "remove" it, even by setting it to `null`.

### Strongly Typed Webhook Payloads

If you're building custom endpoints that respond to OrderCloud.io webhooks, the SDK provides a rich set of models corresponding to the payloads sent in the request body by OrderCloud. In addition to a general-purpose `WebhookPayload` class, there are types corresponding to each specific webhook, with strongly typed `Request`, `Response`, `RouteParams`, and (optionally) a user-specified type for `ConfigData`. These webhook-specific types are nested under `WebhookPayloads.[Resource].[Endpoint]`, mirroring endpoint methods and making them highly discoverable.

```c#
[Route("webhooks/orders/onsubmit")]
public Task HandleOrderSubmit([FromBody] WebhookPayloads.Orders.Submit<MyConfigData> payload)
{
    ...
}
```

See [here](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/ordercloud-dotnet-sdk/issues/11) for more details.

_Note: If you're using ASP.NET Core to build endpoints that respond to webhooks, have a look at the OrderCloud webhook authentication extensions provided by [OrderCloud.AzureApp](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/ordercloud-dotnet-sdk-extensions)._

### Query DSL

Most OrderCloud.io endpoints that return a list allow a set of optional parameters for searching, sorting, filtering, and paging. Like any optional parameters, these can be specified via optional method arguments in the SDK. But an alternative pattern with a fluent query builder syntax and strongly-typed expression support is also provided for list endpoints:

```c#
await Client.Me.ListProductsAsync(opts => opts
    .SearchFor("foo")
    .SearchOn(p => p.Name, p => p.Description)
    .SortBy(p => p.Name)
    .AddFilter(p => p.Active && p.ShipWeight < 100)
    .Page(1)
    .PageSize(100));
```

## FAQ

#### Do I have to use `async`/`await` when calling endpoints?
Yes. (Isn't it refreshing when the answer isn't always "it depends"?) The SDK uses [Flurl.Http](https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl), which uses `HttpClient`, which does not support synchronous calls (and for good reason). Do _not_ use `.Result` or `.Wait()` on calls made with this SDK, ever. These will block threads and potentially cause deadlocks. In short, [don't block on async code](https://blog.stephencleary.com/2012/07/dont-block-on-async-code.html). Use `await`.

#### HttpClient under the hood, eh? So I should use OrderCloudClient as a singleton?
It depends. ;)

The ideal scope is _one instance per set of authorization credentials_. Since the access token is cached and reused by `OrderCloudClient`, creating new instances with the same credentials will result in excessive authorization calls. If you're only using a single set of credentials for the lifetime of your application, using `OrderCloudClient` as a singleton is fully thread-safe. In any case, you do _not_ need to worry about [this infamous problem](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/08/2016-08-27-httpclientwrong/), because the SDK uses a static, lazily-instantiated singleton instance of `HttpClient`, regardless of how many `OrderCloudClient`s are created.

#### Is it IoC-friendly? Testable?
Yes and yes. All service-y classes implement interfaces (`IOrderCloudClient`, `IUserResource`, `IProductResource`, etc.), making them easily compatible with your favorite IoC container and mocking framework.

## Supported Platforms
The SDK targets .NET Framework 4.5 and [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard)  1.3 and 2.0, meaning it'll run just about everywhere .NET runs, including .NET Core 1.0 and 2.0, Mono, Xamarin (iOS and Android), and UWP 10.
